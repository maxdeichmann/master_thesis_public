# Statistical methods of my Master thesis

This repository holds the statistical analyses that I ran for my master thesis. In the thesis I analysed whether Venture Capital funds should use a diversification
or specialisation strategy to be most successful. 
Success was measured with fund ROI and diversification with the Herfindahl Index for geographics, industries and stages the portfolio companies are in.
